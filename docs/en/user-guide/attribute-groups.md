# Attribute Groups

**Attribute Group** – a collection of [attributes](./attributes.md) of a certain kind combined together to make it easier for the customer to understand the product and its features better. As an example, the "screen" attribute group for smartphones may combine such attributes as "screen diagonal", "resolution", "type of matrix", "number of touch points", etc. Each attribute may belong to only one attribute group, which is optional.

## Attribute Group Fields

The attribute group entity comes with the following preconfigured fields; mandatory are marked with *:

| **Field Name**           | **Description**                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Group name (multi-lang)* | Name of the attribute group (e.g. technical) |
| Code *                   | Unique value used to identify the attribute group. It can only consist of lowercase letters, digits and underscore symbols                   |
| Sort order               | Sorting order of the attribute group. With this parameter, attribute groups will be arranged in the appropriate order on the product [detail view](./views-and-panels.md#detail-view) page                   |
| Description (multi-lang) | Description of the attribute group purpose   |
