Each user can create any number of associations. The following associations are created by default:

- Is spare part of

The unused associations can easily be removed.



## How many product catalogs can you manage?

## How many channels can you manage?

You can manage as many channels as you want in TreoPIM. The information for a channel can be transmitted in different ways:

- via API from TreoPIM,
- via API from a third-party system,
- via Export Feeds (Export Feeds module required).


## Is it possible to transmit product information in more than one language via one channel?

Yes, you can transmit multilingual product information via one channel.



## Can you create individualized product information for each channel?

Yes, use the channel-specific attributes for this. In order to create an attribute as channel-specific, you should activate this property for an attribute in a product family.

  

## Can you manage product prices?

In “TreoPIM Price” there is a standard field of the Price type. It is possible to create and use several such fields.

If you plan a complicated price management with graduated prices, different currencies etc., please use our module “Pricing”.



## How is it determined which product information is to be transmitted via which channels?

The category tree concerned is determined by assigning a product to a category. A category tree is assigned to a catalog that can be assigned to one or more channels. The product information for the respective product is also assigned to these channels.
